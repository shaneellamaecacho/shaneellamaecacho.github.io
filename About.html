            <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
            <p id="text1"> Hello, <b>I'm Shane Ella Mae F. Cacho</b>, 18 years old, residing in Cainta Rizal. 
            I am currently enrolled in the <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b> program at <b>Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig.</b>
            Pursuing the BSIT program is undeniably challenging. As I navigate my first year as an IT student, I can affirm that it is no easy feat. 
            However, I remain hopeful that, over time, I will cultivate a genuine love and enjoyment for this program. My other interests 
            include <b>watching Korean drama series and movies, cleaning my space, organizing my belongings, and discovering new things.</b>In terms of my abilities, 
            I believe I possess<b> organizational skills.</b> Ever since, I have had a keen desire for everything to be systematically arranged. This proficiency extends to <b>planning, organizing physical and digital spaces, budgeting, and more. </b>
            This skill has evolved over time as I prefer an organized environment to enhance my overall efficiency and functionality.

            <h1><span>Family Background</span></h1>
            <p id="text2"> There are <b>seven members </b>in our family, which includes <b>me, my mother, father, <br>two brothers, sister, and sister-in-law. </b>
              Our family places a high importance on both <br><b> religion and strong relationships.</b> Attending church every Sunday and spending time <br> with
             God has been a cherished tradition for us. From a young age, my parents <br> instilled in us the <b>significance of family and the presence of
              God in our lives</b>, which <br>has greatly contributed to our personal growth. Furthermore, among my three <br> siblings, I am the <b>youngest</b>, 
              indicating that I am the only one remaining who is still <br> studying. Growing up in a big family is indeed <b>chaotic and fun.</b> </p>
