              Coding isn't my cup of tea, so I'm considering pursuing a future role within my field that doesn't involve coding, such as becoming a<b> User Experience Designer.</b> A User Experience Designer identifies areas for improvement and implements changes on websites or products to enhance the overall user experience. I believe this profession is well-suited to my skills and interests.</p>
